# Project in transition

Currently the project is in transition to a collaborative group effort under a github organisation.

Work is being done to migrate and upgrade all CI/CD integrations from personal accounts to organisation accounts.

Pull requests are welcome, but don't expect anything to be merged until CI/CD infrastucture is up and running.

Many thanks goes to [Brandon Byars](https://github.com/bbyars) for all the effort building mountebank in the first place, for maintaining the project for more than a decade, and finally, for being helpful and collaborative during this transition phase.

# Welcome, friend
Build status: [![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/mountebank-testing/mountebank/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/mountebank-testing/mountebank/tree/master)

mountebank is the only open source service virtualization tool that competes with the commercial offerings
in terms of protocol diversity, capability, and performance. Here's what
[Capital One wrote](https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/moving-one-of-capital-ones-largest-customer-facing-apps-to-aws-668d797af6fc)
about their mobile cloud migration (emphasis theirs):

>In fact, halfway through we discovered our corporate mocking software couldnâ€™t handle the
>sheer amount of performance testing we were running as part of this effort (_we completely crushed
>some pretty industrial enterprise software in the process_). As a result, we made the call to move

>to expand/shrink our mocking needs on demand.

At the moment, the following protocols are implemented, either directly in the tool or as a community extension:
* http
* https
* tcp (text and binary)
* smtp
* ldap
* grpc
* websockets
* graphql
* snmp
* telnet
* ssh
* netconf

mountebank supports mock verification, stubbing with advanced predicates, JavaScript injection,
and record-playback through proxying.

See [getting started](https://www.mbtest.dev/docs/gettingStarted) guide for more information.

## Install and Run

Install:

    npm install -g @mbtest/mountebank

Run:

    mb

There are a number of [command line options](https://www.mbtest.dev/docs/commandLine) if you need
to customize mountebank.

All pre-release versions of mountebank are available with the `beta` [npm tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mountebank).
No `beta` version is published unless it has passed all tests.

## Learn More

After installing and running, view the docs in your browser at <http://localhost:2525>, or visit the
[public site](https://www.mbtest.dev/).

You can always learn more and support mountebank development by buying the book:

## Building

There are two packages: mountebank itself, and a test package called mbTest (which houses all
out-of-process tests against mountebank). First ensure all dependencies are installed for both packages:

    npm install

Then, run all tests:

    npm test

Several other test configurations exist. You can see the CI pipeline in .circleci/config.yml.

There are some tests that require network access.
A few of these tests verify the correct behavior under DNS failures.  If your ISP
is kind enough to hijack the NXDOMAIN DNS response in an attempt to allow you to conveniently peruse their
advertising page, those tests will fail.  I suggest that, under such circumstances, you talk to your ISP
and let them know that their policies are causing mountebank tests to fail. You can also set
the environment variable `MB_AIRPLANE_MODE=true`, which will avoid tests requiring your DNS resolver.
